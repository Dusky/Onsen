/**
 * Every user-facing string in the app.
 *
 * The design handoff is explicit that all product nouns are provisional and
 * will be renamed in production — "Roleplay"/"Scene", "Author", "Cast",
 * "Persona", "Guides", "Steer", "Nudge", "Autopilot", "OOC" and the rest. They
 * are routed through this one module so a rename is one file, not a hunt, and
 * so no component hardcodes vocabulary that is going to change.
 *
 * Corollary: type names, database columns, and route paths take their names
 * from SPEC.md, never from the labels here.
